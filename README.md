<h3>What does it do?</h3>

<p>GoturBAC is a social drinking app that allows you to monitor your own drinking, as well as seeing how far along your friends are. You'll be able to set a preferred BAC level, see the BAC of your friends, and even other users who are at the same location as you are.</p>

<h3>Why should I use it?</h3>

<p>We've all had nights where we took things a little too far. Not only is it fun to see how drunk you are, it can also help you better guage just how much you need to drink to have a good time, and how much may be going overboard. By setting your preferred BAC, you won't have to ask yourself "Should I have one more?"</p>
